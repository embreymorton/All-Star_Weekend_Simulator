# All-Star Weekend Simulator
This is a Java program that simulates the NBA All-Star Weekend's Three-Point Contest and Dunk Contest. 

It generates scores and determines contest winners based on the provided list of NBA players for each contest.

Future Plans for Improvement
-
- Refactor Code: I was much less experienced upon construction of this program
- Enhanced User Experience: Implement visuals to show results outside of just printing to the console
- Potentially rewrite in a different language to implement various NBA related APIs (Python comes to mind)
